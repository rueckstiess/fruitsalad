A script to redact MongoDB log files. 

This script reads a MongoDB log file and outputs a redacted version of the log file, replacing IP addresses, namespaces and query/update data. Namespace details are replaced with generic adjectives, colours and fruit names (hence the name "fruitsalad"). IP addresses are mapped to a private range starting with `192.168.`. The query values are hashed with a standard MD5 algorithm, so that the distribution of data remains unchanged, while the actual data will be lost. Note: The **field names** of the queries are currently left **unchanged**.

This is a very early beta version. 

### Usage

You need to have [mtools](https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools) installed and linked in your `PYTHONPATH` in order for fruitsalad to work. Then run:

```
python fruitsalad.py <logfile>
```

to output the scrambled version to _stdout_, or redirect the output to a file by adding `> redacted.log` to the end of the command.
